b"Daily Briefing: Italy - Europe's latest stalemate,8:44am GMT,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-view-monday/daily-briefing-italy-europes-latest-stalemate-idUKKBN1GH0XY, LONDON (Reuters) - Germany's months-long political deadlock is over . As it emerged that members of the German SPD had voted to continue their grand coalition with Angela Merkel| Italian voters were on Sunday in the process of delivering a hung parliament. Once again the rejection of mainstream parties combined with the rise in anti-establishment forces| tinged with anti-immigrant and eurosceptic sentiment| is the driving factor. Although a rightist alliance led by ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi emerged with the biggest bloc of votes| none of Italy\xe2\x80\x99s three main factions look able to rule alone. Scenarios now include the creation of a more eurosceptic coalition| which would likely challenge EU budget restrictions and be little interested in further European integration| or swift new elections to try to break the deadlock. Winners include the anti-system 5-Star Movement| which saw its support soar to become Italy\xe2\x80\x99s largest single party| and the far-right anti-immigrant League| which did better than Berlusconi\xe2\x80\x99s Forza Italia. The full result should come later on Monday| but expect weeks of uncertainty now: Parliament will meet for the first time on March 23 and formal talks on forming a government won\xe2\x80\x99t start till early April. Slovakia's President Andrej Kiska on Sunday addressed the growing political crisis triggered by the as yet unresolved murder of an investigative journalist who was digging into corruption. While there has been no direct link to the government| the killing of Jan Kuciak has led to street protests by voters angry at what they see as widespread official graft. Kiska said the episode has led to a crisis of public trust in Prime Minister Robert Fico's three-party government and says there must be either personnel changes or early elections. Fico is rejecting any shake-up. MARKETS A weekend of European politics delivered some positive news from Germany| more negative news from Italy but the threat of a looming trade war remained the biggest weight on world markets. Germany\xe2\x80\x99s Social Democrats voted decisively to enter a grand coalition with Chancellor Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s conservatives| leaving the pro-European SPD with key finance and foreign ministries in a new government that\xe2\x80\x99s likely to take power later this month. Italy\xe2\x80\x99s election outcome was a lot messier as expected| with strong showings for anti-establishment parties but no groupings looking strong enough at this stage to form a stable government. A green traffic light is seen next to the Social Democratic Party headquarters in Berlin| March 4| 2018.  REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke Euro/dollar moved about 40 ticks higher to just above $1.2360 on the Germany result late on Sunday| before reversing those gains and then slipping about 40 ticks to $1.2280 this morning as the Italian results came through. Euro/yen| however| fell to a six-month low. More directly| Italy\xe2\x80\x99s 10-year government bond yield jumped more than 10 basis points at one point early Monday| with the spread between Italy and Germany up 11 basis points. The myriad permutations and combinations of outcomes of the Italian vote are still being pored over as the results come in| with markets viewing gridlock and weeks of horse-trading broadly as expected| but the chance of biggest party Five Star taking some place in a new government as negative for the both the national budget and relations with Europe. Italy\xe2\x80\x99s benchmark stock index opened down about 2 percent with euro zone blue chip stocks also lower. But much of these losses were a follow-through from Asia| where bourses fell earlier on rising fears of an international trade war after last week\xe2\x80\x99s announcement by U.S. President Trump of likely U.S. trade tariffs on imported steel and aluminium.  Trump\xe2\x80\x99s move| which will finally be decided on April 11| drew a sharp response from around the globe| with the European Union among others pledging retaliatory measures. Auto stocks are seen opening down 2 percent after Trump threatened European automakers with a tax on imports. Whatever the individual company and sector impacts| investors fear an escalating tit-for-tat trade war would slow world growth and lift inflation generally. U.S. stock futures are down about 0.8 percent| with HK stocks down more than 2 percent| Seoul down more than 1 percent and Tokyo down 0.6 percent. Shanghai stocks bucked that trend| as China\xe2\x80\x99s annual National Congress got underway amid pledges to keep economic growth at 6.5 percent again this year.

The worst snowstorms in nearly 30 years had frozen water in pipes last week| water suppliers said| during a blast of Siberian cold dubbed\xe2\x80\x9cthe Beast from the East\xe2\x80\x9d| which ground planes| stopped trains| blocked roads and shut schools.

The move comes as pricing by Britain\xe2\x80\x99s energy firms is under political scrutiny and a week after\xc2\xa0a law\xc2\xa0was\xc2\xa0introduced aimed at capping bills. The new rule will come into effect at in May for domestic consumers and in November for microbusinesses| Ofgem said.

b'Testing the limits at home| Polish firms look abroad for growth,1h ago,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-poland-m-a/testing-the-limits-at-home-polish-firms-look-abroad-for-growth-idUKKBN1GH0Q1?il=0,GDYNIA| Poland (Reuters) - Trans Polonia Group faces a problem confronting many ambitious mid-sized Polish companies: it is starting to outgrow its home market.  The group\xe2\x80\x99s trucks already supply a quarter of the fuel delivered by road to filling stations across Poland| and Trans Polonia (TPG) has decided that to keep expanding it must look West. That means not simply serving foreign clients from a Polish base| but buying a presence abroad. Western companies| especially those in neighbouring Germany| have been investing in Poland since soon after the fall of communism. Now rapidly increasing amounts of investment capital are flowing in the opposite direction as firms like TPG try to get closer to customers in the biggest European economies. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to expand then you need to buy a company or companies which are located in the West|\xe2\x80\x9d TPG chief executive Dariusz Cegielski told Reuters. Based near the Baltic port of Gdansk| his group is considering potential targets in Germany| Belgium and the Netherlands with annual turnovers of more than 50 million euros (43.5 million pounds). Mid-sized companies in other central European countries have already had to make international pushes due to their relatively small domestic economies. By contrast| Polish firms have relied for longer on a home market whose population of 38 million is larger than that of the Czech Republic| Slovakia and Hungary combined. Despite robust economic growth| Polish companies now appear to be testing the limits of the local market. Direct investment abroad more than doubled between 2014 and 2016 alone to $6.4 billion| according to the United Nations trade agency UNCTAD. TPG already bought Poland\xe2\x80\x99s biggest fuel trucking company three years ago. Now it wants to expand beyond this domestic business into a more international industry: intermodal transportation of liquid chemicals| which uses tanks that can be loaded between ships| trains and trucks with container cranes. Western European petrochemical companies are active in eastern EU member states such as Poland| and further east in Russia. But for transport companies like TPG to tap into this business| they need to use established client relationships which have often been built up at a local level over many years. \xe2\x80\x9cThis you can achieve only via potential acquisitions. You cannot realise this through organic growth|\xe2\x80\x9d said Cegielski. TAKING THE LEAP While TPG is just getting started| some mid-sized Polish firms have already taken the leap| encouraging others. \xe2\x80\x9cSuccessful acquisitions by Polish companies...have made other Polish investors feel more confident to think about themselves as potential foreign investors|\xe2\x80\x9d Magdalena Komor| Manager in Mergers & Acquisitions at PwC in Warsaw| told Reuters. One example is household appliance maker Amica| which agreed to buy British kitchen appliance company CDA Group in 2015 for 24.3 million pounds. \xe2\x80\x9cPolish entrepreneurs who have found success in the domestic market have reached certain barriers to further development in Poland and need to think about foreign expansion|\xe2\x80\x9d Amica\xe2\x80\x99s deputy chief executive Piotr Skubel said. Some are moving beyond Europe. Drug maker Adamed Group took a controlling stake in Vietnamese pharmaceutical company Dat Vi Phu last year in one of the biggest investments by a Polish company in southeast Asia. Before that Adamed Group bought four companies in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Trans Polonia Group tanker is pictured in this undated photo taken in Gdansk| Poland. Trans Polonia Group/Handout via REUTERSFor many of companies Germany is the ideal destination due to a shared border and the size of the country\xe2\x80\x99s market| said Stepan Flieger| head of EY\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Czech M&A; team.   \xe2\x80\x9cGermany is a huge opportunity and Polish companies are starting to realise if you want to do business in Germany you cannot simply export. They will always prefer to buy from a German.\xe2\x80\x9d A temptation is to try to move some operations from a German acquisition back to Poland| where average wages were 44 percent lower in 2016| according to OECD data. \xe2\x80\x9cUsually when a manufacturing company invests abroad| let\xe2\x80\x99s say in Germany| ultimately it plans to relocate manufacturing to Poland where it can be done at lower cost| and to leave sales| distribution and more value-added activities in the country of the investment|\xe2\x80\x9d said Tomasz Pasiewicz| managing partner at Warsaw-based advisory firm Saski Partners.  This is a sensitive issue in the\xe2\x80\x9cMittelstand\xe2\x80\x9d| the mid-sized German companies that pride themselves on creating high quality jobs in the small towns where they are often based. Slideshow (3 Images)But Langendorf| a German truck trailer maker which Polish rival Wielton bought last year| says its experience has been positive. No jobs have been lost to Poland since Wielton agreed to buy the firm based in the former mining town of Waltrop for a maximum of 10 million euros. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary| the workforce in Germany has grown since the takeover|\xe2\x80\x9d Langendorf spokesman Robert Otto said| adding that employees\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9cinitial concerns were quickly dispelled\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cLangendorf has already taken over central tasks from the main group|\xe2\x80\x9d Otto said.\xe2\x80\x9cSales activities are being expanded significantly| which of course also means an increase in staff.\xe2\x80\x9d GOVERNMENT SUPPORT Poland\xe2\x80\x99s right-wing nationalist government is also playing a role. Since coming to power in 2015| it has slowed privatisations| moved to bring banks back under local control and come into conflict with the European Commission over a variety of issues including the independence of the judiciary. Amid the uncertainty| foreign direct investment into Poland has fallen from $14.3 billion in 2014 to $11.4 billion in 2016. But the ruling PiS party has made foreign expansion of Polish firms one of the priorities for promoting economic growth under its\xe2\x80\x9cStrategy for Responsible Development\xe2\x80\x9d. The Polish Investment and Trade Agency| which began operating in its current form in 2017| received 600 inquiries last year about possible foreign acquisitions.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe have set up an incomparably better support network for Polish small businesses over the past 12 to 13 months of this project than what was available to them in the past five or six years|\xe2\x80\x9d Executive Vice President Wojciech Fedko said.     Piotr Krupa| Founder and Chief Executive of Warsaw-listed debt collection company Kruk| said he has noticed a change in government attitudes. Kruk| which is valued at $1.17 billion on the Warsaw stock exchange| has recently made acquisitions in Spain and Italy to take advantage of the high number of non-performing loans in these countries following the global and euro zone crises. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit different than a few years ago|\xe2\x80\x9d Krupa told Reuters.\xe2\x80\x9cNobody wanted to help us and discuss Kruk| from government| about our expansion abroad.

After hitting a 6-month low at the open| the pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.3 percent by 0825 GMT. Italy\xe2\x80\x99s FTSE MIB blue-chip index was down 1 percent| also a six-month low.  Gains in energy and materials stocks however supported the broader marker. They were helped by a rise in crude oil prices ahead of a meeting between OPEC and U.S. shale firms that raised expectations that producers would discuss further how to clear a global oil glut.  Italy faces a prolonged period of political instability after voters delivered a hung parliament in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s election| spurning traditional parties and flocking to anti-establishment and far-right groups in record numbers.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe expect lengthy negotiations after these elections| which may lead to increased volatility of Italian assets|\xe2\x80\x9d said Matteo Ramenghi| CIO at UBS WM Italy.

With votes counted from more than 75 percent of polling stations| it looked almost certain that none of the three main factions would be able to govern alone and there was little prospect of a return to mainstream government| creating a dilemma for the European Union. A rightist alliance including former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi\xe2\x80\x99s Forza Italia (Go Italy!) held the biggest bloc of votes. In a bitter personal defeat that appeared unlikely last week| the billionaire media magnate\xe2\x80\x99s party looked almost certain to be overtaken by its ally| the far-right League| which campaigned on a fiercely anti-migrant ticket. But the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement saw its support soar to become Italy\xe2\x80\x99s largest single party by far| and one of its senior officials said on Monday that forming a coalition without it would be impossible. The League\xe2\x80\x99s economics chief on Monday raised the possibility of an alliance with 5-Star. Any government based on that combination would be euro-sceptic| likely to challenge EU budget restrictions and be little interested in further European integration. Related CoverageMediaset shares fall after Berlusconi party disappoints in voteThe full result is not due until later on Monday and| with the centre-right coalition on course for 37 percent of the vote and 5-Star for 31 percent| swift new elections to try to break the deadlock are another plausible scenario. Despite overseeing a modest economic recovery| the ruling centre-left coalition trailed a distant third on 22 percent| hit by widespread anger over persistent poverty| high unemployment and an influx of more than 600|000 migrants over the past four years. Prolonged political stalemate could make heavily indebted Italy the focus of market concern in Europe| now that the threat of German instability has receded after the revival on Sunday of a grand coalition under Chancellor Angela Merkel. In early European trading| the euro dipped while investors dumped Italian government debt| with the yield on its 10-year bonds jumping 10 basis points.  \xe2\x80\x9cItaly is far from having sorted its long-standing problems| and now it will have new ones.

However| Italy has a long history of finding a way out of apparently intractable political stalemate. The 5-Star once rejected talk of any power sharing| but it now says it is willing to discuss common policies but not negotiate over cabinet posts. Led by 31-year-old Luigi Di Maio| the movement was formed in 2009 and has fed off public fury over institutional corruption and economic hardship. Some have questioned whether other parties would be able to work with it. \xe2\x80\x9cDi Maio wins| Italy ungovernable|\xe2\x80\x9d was the front page headline on La Stampa newspaper. Slideshow (11 Images)Claudio Borghi| the League\xe2\x80\x99s economics chief| on Monday suggested that| with Berlusconi on course to lose the leadership of the centre right for the first time since he entered politics in 1994| a centre-right headed by League leader Matteo Salvini could find a modus vivendi with 5-Star. Borghi cited as an example the cancellation of a constitutional requirement to balance the budget. Meanwhile senior 5-Star member Riccardo Fraccaro said nobody would be able to govern without his party.\xe2\x80\x9cWe will ... (talk) with all the parties about what this country needs.\xe2\x80\x9d Five-Star and the League once shared strong anti-euro views. The League still says it wants to leave the single currency but 5-Star now says the time for quitting it has passed. Its flagship proposal in the election campaign was a minimum monthly income of up to 780 euros (697 pounds) for the poor| helping it draw massive support in the underdeveloped south. By contrast| Salvini and Berlusconi - heading for 18 percent and 14 percent respectively - appeared to have dominated the wealthier north| with the centre-left squeezed into a narrow stretch of central Italy. \xe2\x80\x9cWe did not anticipate this rationalisation of the electorate... We are going to have to ... find a response|\xe2\x80\x9d said senior PD politician Ettore Rosato. There was much speculation on Sunday night that PD leader and ex-prime minister Matteo Renzi would step down.  Anti-establishment parties have been on the rise across Europe since the 2008 financial crisis.

IHS Markit\xe2\x80\x99s Final Composite Purchasing Managers\xe2\x80\x99 Index| seen as a good overall indicator of growth for the euro zone| fell to 57.1 in February from January\xe2\x80\x99s 58.8 and down from the flash estimate of 57.5. January\xe2\x80\x99s reading was a level not seen since June 2006. But the slight slip last month leaves the PMI well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. \xe2\x80\x9cThe euro zone economy looks to have hit a speed bump in February after a stellar start to the year.

Williamson said the PMI was consistent with GDP rising at a buoyant rate of 0.8 to 0.9 percent| which at the upper end would be the strongest since the second quarter of 2010.  Momentum in the bloc has peaked| according to a Reuters poll last week that predicted quarterly growth of 0.6 percent and said the ECB would drop its easing bias on stimulus by or at the June meeting [ECILT/EU]. Alongside growth| inflationary pressures also eased a little last month and the output price index dipped to 54.4 from 54.8. Inflation slowed to a 14-month low in February of 1.2 percent| well below the ECB\xe2\x80\x99s target of close to but below 2.0 percent| official data showed last week.

Related CoverageAXA\xe2\x80\x99s takeover of XL comes just over a month after rival American International Group said it would buy reinsurer Validus for around $5.6 billion.    AXA Chief Executive Thomas Buberl said the deal will enable AXA| predominantly a life and savings insurer| to dominate the global property and casualty market. \xe2\x80\x9cThe transaction offers significant long-term value creation for our stakeholders with increased risk diversification| higher cash remittance potential and reinforced growth prospects|\xe2\x80\x9d Buberl said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe future AXA will see its profile significantly rebalanced towards insurance risks and away from financial risks|\xe2\x80\x9d he added. However| AXA shares fell 5 percent in early trading| as some analysts said the XL deal looked pricey. \xe2\x80\x9cIn our view| the acquisition of XL fits AXA\xe2\x80\x99s strategy of growing in commercial insurance. However| the purchase price looks quite high even after synergy effects and AXA\xe2\x80\x99s debt ratio is again rather stretched|\xe2\x80\x9d said analysts at German brokerage Bankhaus Lampe| who kept a\xe2\x80\x9chold\xe2\x80\x9d rating on AXA shares. AXA| which ranks as Europe\xe2\x80\x99s second-biggest insurer in terms of market capitalization behind Germany\xe2\x80\x99s Allianz| said it would finance the XL deal via debt| cash and the proceeds of the forthcoming flotation of its U.S. business. It added it expected the XL takeover to be cash accretive| and to result in cost synergies of around $400 million per year| based on pre-tax earnings. AXA also reaffirmed its 2020 financial targets| under which the French insurer aims to increase earnings per share by 3 to 7 percent a year over the 2016-2020 period. AXA has not been hit as hard as some of its rivals by a series of costly natural catastrophes in 2017| thanks to reinsurance contracts and its diversified business model. AXA reported higher than expected net 2017 profit of 6.2 billion euros last month. Law firm Skadden said it was advising XL over the AXA takeover.

Below are some initial reactions to the vote:  ALBERTO GALLO| FUND MANAGER & HEAD OF MACRO STRATEGIES| ALGEBRIS \xe2\x80\x9cThere are so many scenarios that it is hard to say which government will be formed but| if parties avoid stepping back on reforms already done \xe2\x80\x94 because the economy is growing and there are more jobs \xe2\x80\x94 the markets should not worry too much about these results| which were broadly in line with expectations.\xe2\x80\x9d LORENZO PORTELLI| STRATEGIST| AMUNDI \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to wait for final results and a clearer picture could emerge as soon as this afternoon. The possibility that no coalition would reach the majority was widely expected. Negotiations starting from March 23 will be crucial. At the moment we do not believe at the hypothesis of a populist government. We are in a very fluid framework and we cannot exclude some type of government with a short-term mandate to reform the electoral law. It is important to underline that| with respect to 2013| both the 5-Star and the League have smoothed their euro-sceptic tones: they have focused mainly on immigration and security issues.\xe2\x80\x9d        ALESSANDRO TENTORI| CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER| AXA \xe2\x80\x9cThe political message of the vote is one thing| but the implementation of the government remains difficult. We believe we are heading towards a technocrat government. There is a strong message from the voters| but it did not secure a majority for any of the political parties. I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect big movements on markets because an inconclusive outcome was already priced in. It would be different if in the next few hours the possibility of a Europe-sceptic alliance| such as between the 5-Star and the League| materialised| but that seems unlikely.\xe2\x80\x9d NICOLA NOBILE| ECONOMIST| OXFORD ECONOMICS \xe2\x80\x9cA vote dictated by gut feelings: it remains to be seen what happens now| whether the (anti-establishment) 5-Star decides to find an agreement with the League or with the PD. At the moment everything is uncertain| and the situation could remain like that until the appointment of the speakers of the lower house and of the Senate. We expect a couple of weeks of absolute uncertainty. \xe2\x80\x9cA parliament without a majority was widely expected| but what the market did not foresee is a boost of the populist movements and the weak performance of the moderate parties. It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how exactly the 5-Star or the League| which together hold more than 50 percent| stand on issues relating to Europe or the banking union.\xe2\x80\x9d   RAFFAELLA TENCONI| ECONOMIST| ADA ECONOMICS  \xe2\x80\x9cThe market reaction won\xe2\x80\x99t be very positive: both the PD and (Silvio Berlusconi\xe2\x80\x99s) Forza Italia did worse than expected and worse than polls had predicted. With the League this strong| Matteo Salvini could ask to be appointed prime minister and this could put the centre-right coalition at risk.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere are two options| in our view: a centre-right coalition or a coming together of the League and 5-Star. We don\xe2\x80\x99t believe there will be a repeat vote because - whether this is good or bad - in Italy eventually you always get to an agreement. It could take a couple of weeks| which is relatively short if compared with other European countries.\xe2\x80\x9d MATTEO RAMENGHI| CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER FOR ITALY| UBS WEALTH MANAGEMENT  \xe2\x80\x9cWe expect lengthy negotiations after these elections| which may lead to increased volatility of Italian assets. A broad grand coalition would be well received by markets as it could result in political stability and fiscal discipline. Repeat elections could prolong uncertainty and weigh on Italian assets. The Italian equity market has not priced in electoral uncertainty| but current yields on government bonds suggest they have incorporated some political risk.\xe2\x80\x9d FABIO FOIS| ANALYST| BARCLAYS  \xe2\x80\x9cWe expect the formation of a wide and heterogeneous coalition that could include anti-system parties. We do not expect such a coalition to deliver meaningful structural reforms| and depending on its composition| we see the risk that previous reforms could be unravelled. Over the medium term| we remain of the view that the next legislature will be characterized by political instability that could culminate in government crisis and or snap elections.\xe2\x80\x9d Our Standards:\n"
b'BOJ deputy governor nominee warns against premature exit from easy policy,2h ago,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-japan-boj-nominee-wakatabe/boj-deputy-governor-nominee-warns-against-premature-exit-from-easy-policy-idUKKBN1GH0JT?il=0,TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan must avoid a premature exit from its ultra easy policy and consider ramping up stimulus if needed to pull the economy out of deflation| Masazumi Wakatabe| one of the two nominees for BOJ deputy governor| said on Monday. Wakatabe| an academic known as a vocal advocate of aggressive easing| said the merits of the BOJ\xe2\x80\x99s stimulus program\xe2\x80\x9cfar exceeded\xe2\x80\x9d the costs| brushing aside criticism from some analysts that prolonged monetary easing was straining Japan\xe2\x80\x99s banking system. Central bank governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Friday rattled markets by flagging for the first time the prospect of an exit from accommodative policy if his inflation target was met| sending the yen higher and bond prices lower. While Wakatabe\xe2\x80\x99s remarks on Monday were markedly more dovish than those of his boss| economists say they are more measured than some of his earlier ideas about policy| which argued for the need for more aggressive easing. Related Coverage\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s most important is to make a full exit from deflation. The BOJ\xe2\x80\x99s 2 percent inflation target is effective and meaningful for this purpose|\xe2\x80\x9d Wakatabe said in a confirmation hearing in the lower house of parliament. \xe2\x80\x9cPrematurely shifting the BOJ\xe2\x80\x99s easy policy could pull Japan back to deflation|\xe2\x80\x9d he said| adding that the BOJ must be ready to ramp up stimulus if doing so is needed to hit its price goal. Both Wakatabe and career central banker Masayoshi Amamiya appeared before parliament| having been nominated by the government to become deputy BOJ governors| when the posts become vacant on March 20. The government reappointed Kuroda to serve another five-year term when the current one ends on April 8 and parliament is expected to approve both Wakatabe\xe2\x80\x99s and Amamiya\xe2\x80\x99s nominations. Wakatabe told lawmakers there were\xe2\x80\x9cno limits\xe2\x80\x9d to what monetary policy can do to stimulate the economy| and was open to the idea of raising the BOJ\xe2\x80\x99s inflation target if doing so could help change public perceptions that deflation will persist. But he held off from proposing some of the more radical ideas he had floated as an academic| such as accelerating the pace of the BOJ\xe2\x80\x99s bond buying or bankrolling government debt. \xe2\x80\x9cWakatabe is known as an advocate of additional easing. He tends to sound dovish| but in parliament his comments sounded a little more cautious than the statements he has made as an academic|\xe2\x80\x9d said Hiroshi Miyazaki| senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. Wakatabe| however| could propose expanding stimulus if the BOJ slashes its inflation forecasts in a quarterly review of its projections next month| Miyazaki said. RIGHT-HAND MAN In contrast| Amamiya| the other deputy nominee who has served as Kuroda\xe2\x80\x99s right-hand man as the BOJ\xe2\x80\x99s executive director overseeing monetary policy| mostly echoed the governor\xe2\x80\x99s views on monetary policy - a sign the two will continue to work hand in hand on key policy decisions. Elaborating on what the BOJ\xe2\x80\x99s exit strategy could look like| he said the bank had the necessary tools to engineer a smooth exit once the appropriate time to do so comes. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the time comes| we\xe2\x80\x99re quite capable technically to gradually and stably adjust interest rates while ensuring markets remain stable|\xe2\x80\x9d Amamiya said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re studying what means we have| how they could be used and how (adjustments in rates) could affect the BOJ\xe2\x80\x99s profits|\xe2\x80\x9d he added. After three years of heavy asset buying failed to fire up inflation| the BOJ revamped its policy framework in 2016 to one targeting interest rates from the pace of money printing. It now guides short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year government bond yield around zero percent| while allowing its bond purchases to slow significantly. Some lawmakers and policymakers have voiced concerns over the rising cost of the BOJ\xe2\x80\x99s massive stimulus program| such as the hit to bank profits from years of near-zero rates.

Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said on Sunday the source of the outbreak| which has been blamed for 180 deaths| is the Enterprise facility in Polokwane and that inquiries were ongoing at a second facility owned by the same firm. Motsoaledi said although RCL Foods had not been identified as a source of the outbreak| a facility owned by RCL was under investigation. He announced a recall of polony products made by the two companies. The minister also told South Africans not to consume ready-to-eat processed meat across the board due to the risk of cross-contamination. Tiger Brands shares fell more than 10 percent at market open before paring losses to stand down 6.7 percent to 396.49 rand at 0744 GMT. Tiger Brands said it had suspended operations at both Enterprise manufacturing facilities in Polokwane and Germiston.   Shares in RCL Foods fell more than 6 percent before paring losses. At 0727 GMT they were down 1.34 percent at 16.97 rand. RCL said it was recalling its polony products even though test results were still pending.

When completed| the first phase of the $3.4 billion complex on Muara Besar island| run by China\xe2\x80\x99s Hengyi Group| will be Brunei\xe2\x80\x99s largest-ever foreign investment project| and comes at a time when the oil-dependent country needs it the most.  Brunei\xe2\x80\x99s oil and gas reserves are expected to run out within two decades. As production falls| oil firms won\xe2\x80\x99t be investing much into existing facilities| further hampering output| oil analysts say. As a result| the country\xe2\x80\x99s oil revenues| which provide virtually all of Brunei\xe2\x80\x99s government spending| are in steady decline. With youth unemployment rising| Brunei\xe2\x80\x99s ruler| Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah| is trying to quickly reform the economy and diversify its sources of income| while fighting graft and cracking down on dissent. Brunei\xe2\x80\x99s changing fortunes have been reflected its financial industry. HSBC pulled out of Brunei last year| while Citibank exited in 2014 after 41 years. Bank of China| meanwhile| opened its first branch in the sultanate in December 2016.  The Muara Besar project is promising over 10|000 jobs| at least half of which would go to fresh graduates| media reports in Brunei said. But claims that thousands of Chinese workers have been shipped in to build the complex has angered some local residents. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no jobs for us| so why create some for the Chinese?\xe2\x80\x9d asked one shopkeeper in the capital city.      \xe2\x80\x98MARITIME SILK ROAD\xe2\x80\x99 Hengyi Industries| the local company building the refinery|  did not respond to requests for comment. The company| founded in 2011 and based in Bandar Seri Begawan| expects to complete the first phase of the refinery and petrochemical complex on Muara Besar by the end of the year| according to its website. A $12 billion second phase will expand the refinery capacity to 281|150 barrels per day| and build units to produce 1.5 million tonnes per year (tpy) of ethylene and 2 million tpy of \xc2\xa0paraxylene| the company said last month. Total Chinese investment in Brunei is now estimated at $4.1 billion| according to the American Enterprise Institute\xe2\x80\x99s China Global investment tracker.  That will almost certainly rise as China ramps its\xe2\x80\x9cBelt and Road\xe2\x80\x9d initiative. Sometimes called the\xe2\x80\x9c21st Century Maritime Silk Road| it envisages linking China with Southeast Asia| Africa and Eurasia through a complex network of ports| roads| railways and industrial parks. \xe2\x80\x9cBrunei is an important country along the 21st century Maritime Silk Road|\xe2\x80\x9d China\xe2\x80\x99s Ambassador to Brunei Yang Jian said at the opening ceremony in February 2017 for a joint venture| running Brunei\xe2\x80\x99s largest container terminal. Accumulated U.S. foreign investment in Brunei| by contrast| was just $116 million in 2012| the latest figures available| according to the U.S. State Department.

Brunei has not commented publicly about its territorial claims in the South China Sea. WHITTLING BACK BENEFITS There was a time not so long ago| with oil prices over $100 a barrel| when Brunei citizens could care less about jobs at a refinery.  Squeezed between two Malaysian states on the island of Borneo| Brunei provided cradle-to-grave benefits for its 420|000 citizens| including zero taxes| subsidised housing and free education and health care. But the sultan has had to whittle back some of those benefits \xe2\x80\x94 Brunei has been in recession for three straight years \xe2\x80\x94 and tighten up the ship of state. Slideshow (2 Images)The 71-year-old Bolkiah| the world\xe2\x80\x99s second-longest reigning monarch| reshuffled his cabinet again last month| replacing six top ministers \xe2\x80\x94 just over a couple of years after they were appointed. No explanation was given. Sources close to the government and foreign diplomats say Bolkiah wanted to weed out corruption| and address grumbling among the Malay-Muslim majority who are unhappy with the pullback in welfare programs| budget cuts and unemployment. In the last available official report in 2014| the unemployment rate was put at 6.9 percent. Unofficial figures suggest youth unemployment could be as high as 15 percent. \xe2\x80\x9cA majority in Brunei expect a job in the government| state linked firms or in the oil and gas sector. But all three have been hit pretty hard|\xe2\x80\x9d said one Western diplomat. Bolkiah| who is also the Prime Minister| controls the key portfolios of defence| finance and foreign affairs.  The Sultan\xe2\x80\x99s office did not respond to a request for comment to this story. At the annual parliamentary session on Monday| Bokhliah said the government must cut its dependence on oil and gas| and explore other avenues of economic growth. \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough global demand has risen and oil prices are rebounding| economic growth remains at a low level|\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a speech to cabinet ministers and parliamentarians. \xe2\x80\x9cTherefore we still need to control the fiscal balance of the country in the short and long term.\xe2\x80\x9d The Sultan is still popular in Brunei and marked 50 years in power last October| with a glittering procession through the capital on a gilded chariot| cheered by well-wishers.

Ko Un| 84| who denied any\xe2\x80\x9chabitual misconduct\xe2\x80\x9d in a statement made through his British publisher| first faced allegations when fellow South Korean poet Choi Young-mi released a poem in December titled\xe2\x80\x9cMonster\xe2\x80\x9d| which describes harassment by an older male poet named\xe2\x80\x9cEn\xe2\x80\x9d. South Koreans have widely interpreted it to refer to Ko| seizing on passages that match his biography| including references to the buzz surrounding the unnamed poet\xe2\x80\x99s Nobel Prize chances. While not confirming the identity| Choi has not denied the public identification of Ko and last month she told a TV interviewer that she had been harassed by a famous poet who\xe2\x80\x9crepeatedly harassed female writers\xe2\x80\x9d. Neither Choi nor Ko\xe2\x80\x99s publisher| Bloodaxe Books| responded to requests for comment.

The growing number of high-profile accusations has led President Moon Jae-in to urge law enforcement authorities to investigate reports of sexual abuse. Choi\xe2\x80\x99s oblique allegations have been corroborated by other writers| including poet Lee Hye-mi| who said on Facebook that she witnessed\xe2\x80\x9cridiculous behaviour\xe2\x80\x9d while co-hosting a TV show with Ko.

The 2018 defence budget will be 1.11 trillion yuan| according to a report issued at the opening of China\xe2\x80\x99s annual meeting of parliament. The defence spending figure is closely watched around the world for clues to China\xe2\x80\x99s strategic intentions as it develops new military capabilities| including stealth fighters| aircraft carriers and anti-satellite missiles. China will\xe2\x80\x9cadvance all aspects of military training and war preparedness| and firmly and resolvedly safeguard national sovereignty| security| and development interests\xe2\x80\x9d| Premier Li Keqiang told the opening session in an address. \xe2\x80\x9cFaced with profound changes in the national security environment\xe2\x80\x9d the absolute leadership of the military by the ruling Communist Party must be observed| and the unity between the government and the military| and the people and the military| must always be\xe2\x80\x9cstrong as stone\xe2\x80\x9d| he said. Li also said China had basically completed efforts to cut back the size of its armed forces by 300|000| a move President Xi Jinping announced in 2015 to improve efficiency that had caused unease in the ranks.  The 2018 defence spending increase comes as China\xe2\x80\x99s economic growth expanded 6.9 percent last year| the first acceleration in annual growth since 2010. But China kept its 2018 economic growth target at around 6.5 percent| said Li| the same as in 2017| despite exceeding that year\xe2\x80\x99s target. Last year| defence spending was set to increase by just 7 percent| to 1.044 trillion yuan ($164.60 billion)| or about one-quarter of the proposed U.S. defence spending for the year. In 2016| it grew by 7.6 percent. \xe2\x80\x9cThe pace and scale of this build-up is really dramatic. It is extremely alarming for Australia and many other countries in the region|\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam Roggeveen| a visiting fellow at the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre of the Australian National University in Canberra. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is every indication that China wants to expand what it will call defence capabilities in the South China Sea. I expect eventually we will see warships and aircraft there regularly| if not based there permanently. What is unclear| however| is whether the United States will want to rise to that challenge.\xe2\x80\x9d HIDDEN SPENDING China does not provide a breakdown of how it allocates its defence budget| leading neighbours and other military powers to complain that Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s lack of transparency has added to regional tension.  Diplomats say China\xe2\x80\x99s defence numbers probably underestimate true military spending for the People\xe2\x80\x99s Liberation Army| the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest armed forces| which are in the midst of an impressive modernisation programme overseen by Xi. One senior Asia diplomat| speaking before the announcement| said the real rise would probably be at least double what China revealed| considering its efforts to build up the industrial military complex and deepen military-civilian integration.  \xe2\x80\x9cSome spending will be hidden in civilian spending|\xe2\x80\x9d said the diplomat| speaking on condition of anonymity. China\xe2\x80\x99s military build-up has rattled the nerves of its neighbours| particularly because of its increasingly assertive stance in territorial disputes in the East and South China Seas and over Taiwan| which Beijing claims as its own. \xe2\x80\x9cWe would like to see China be more transparent about its  defence policy| including spending and the direction of its military power|\xe2\x80\x9d Japan\xe2\x80\x99s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a regular briefing. With worries about potential disputes with the United States in the region| China\xe2\x80\x99s military had mounted what defence sources and diplomats viewed as a lobbying campaign for more spending. In an article on its website| China\xe2\x80\x99s Defence Ministry cited Chen Zhou| a researcher at the Academy of Military Science| as saying the spending increase was\xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d and\xe2\x80\x9csustainable\xe2\x80\x9d| and that there were no\xe2\x80\x9chidden military funds\xe2\x80\x9d. U.S. President Donald Trump has proposed a military budget that is the largest since 2011 and focused on beefing up the United States\xe2\x80\x99 nuclear defences and countering the growing strength of China and Russia.  The proposal| part of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s budget request for the U.S. government| would provide the Pentagon $617 billion and an additional $69 billion to fund ongoing wars in fiscal year 2019. That is $74 billion more than in the previous fiscal year\xe2\x80\x99s budget. Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Yesui on Sunday said China\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9cmoderate\xe2\x80\x9d defence spending rises in the past few years were less than other major countries and would not threaten anyone.

The ExxonMobil Hides Gas Conditioning Plant process area is seen in Papua New Guinea in this handout photo dated March 1| 2018.  ExxonMobil/Handout via REUTERSHere are five facts about one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most remote and challenging liquefied natural gas (LNG) and condensate production and export facilities. REMOTE LOCATION The Papua New Guinea LNG (PNG LNG) project opened in 2014 in the South Pacific country| one of Asia\xe2\x80\x99s poorest and most politically troubled despite its resource wealth. The main processing facility| the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant| sits in the rugged highlands of Hela Province and handles up to 1 billion cubic feet of gas daily from eight wells. The site\xe2\x80\x99s remote location required chartering huge Russian Antonov cargo planes to deliver equipment to a jungle airfield at Komo| the longest airstrip in Papua New Guinea. Hides is linked by a 700-km (435 miles) pipeline snaking through the jungle to the LNG plant and export terminal near the capital city Port Moresby. (GRAPHIC: Papua New Guinea quake IMG| tmsnrt.rs/2ow1YLR)    QUAKE DAMAGE A powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck near the Hides facility on Feb. 25| killing dozens of people and knocking out production. The quake damaged power infrastructure and the Komo airfield.  Before it can restart the facility| Exxon will inspect the pipeline and check the gas field for structural damage.     The ExxonMobil Hides Gas Conditioning Plant process area is seen in Papua New Guinea in this handout photo dated March 1| 2018.  ExxonMobil/Handout via REUTERSThe export facility near Port Moresby| where the gas is liquefied for shipment on tankers| was not damaged| Exxon has said. PRICE TAG Exxon\xe2\x80\x99s main partners in the project are currently Australia\xe2\x80\x99s Oil Search (OSH.AX) and Santos (STO.AX). In 2012| Exxon blamed unfavourable foreign exchange rates and delays caused by disgruntled workers and landowners for a $3.3 billion spike in costs| raising the price tag to $19 billion. However| Exxon stunned markets when it completed the project in 2014| ahead of schedule and producing at up to 25 percent above its annual 6.9 million tonnes nameplate capacity. TROUBLED PAST Not all has gone smoothly for Exxon in Papua New Guinea. In November 2017| the company evacuated some staff and suspended\xe2\x80\x9cnon-essential work\xe2\x80\x9d due to unrest in Hela Province. The violence was linked to national elections and disputes over royalties from the PNG LNG project. In 2012| a landslide near a quarry used by Exxon killed at least 25 people and raised questions about the safety of excavations. Exxon said it had closed the quarry five months before the landslide. BIGGER FUTURE Only days before the Feb. 25 quake| Exxon said it had agreed to plans with French energy major Total (TOTF.PA) to double capacity at PNG LNG at an estimated cost of $13 billion.  It was not clear if the quake had affected those plans. Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n"

b"China keeps growth target at 6.5 percent| stays focused on financial risks,2h ago,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-china-parliament/china-keeps-growth-target-at-6-5-percent-stays-focused-on-financial-risks-idUKKBN1GH0A6?il=0,BEIJING (Reuters) - China aims to expand its economy by around 6.5 percent this year| the same as in 2017| while pressing ahead with its campaign to reduce risks in the financial system| Premier Li Keqiang said Monday.  The goal was kept unchanged even though the economy grew 6.9 percent last year and exceeded the government\xe2\x80\x99s target. Sources previously told Reuters that China will maintain its growth target at\xe2\x80\x9caround 6.5 percent\xe2\x80\x9d.      Economists had already expected the world\xe2\x80\x99s second-largest economy to lose some momentum this year as the government deepens its push to contain a build-up in corporate debt| while a war on pollution and a cooling property market weigh on its manufacturers.  Reinforcing views that Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s attention remains firmly fixed on credit risks and better quality growth| when Li unveiled the GDP target he omitted previous wording saying growth could be\xe2\x80\x9chigher if possible.\xe2\x80\x9d   In his annual work report| Li also said China has cut its budget deficit target for the first time since 2012| suggesting Beijing will be more watchful of fiscal spending while not tapping the brakes so hard that it risks a sharper slowdown. \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy wise| the report definitely has a tightening bias|\xe2\x80\x9d said Betty Wang| senior China economist at ANZ in Hong Kong.\xe2\x80\x9cIn line with expectations| the government is pushing through their reform agenda.\xe2\x80\x9d But last week\xe2\x80\x99s escalation in trade tensions with the United States has jumped to the top of the list of uncertainties facing China this year.  President Donald Trump said he would impose hefty tariffs on imported steel and aluminum to protect U.S. producers| risking retaliation from major trade partners like China and sparking fears of a global trade war.   Li said China opposes protectionism and supports the settlement of trade disputes through negotiation| but will\xe2\x80\x9cresolutely safeguard\xe2\x80\x9d its legitimate rights and interest. Related CoverageChina cuts budget deficit ratio for first time since 2012China says supports negotiation to settle trade disputesYet| China will keep its yuan currency basically stable| Li said in remarks to the opening of the annual meeting of parliament.  He said a steady rise in import and export volumes can be expected this year| a view unchanged from a year ago. No export target was given for the third straight year.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe can expect continued recovery of the global economy| but there are also many factors that bring instability and uncertainty|\xe2\x80\x9d the premier said.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe policy changes of the major economies and their spillover effects create uncertainty; protectionism is mounting| and geopolitical risks are on the ascent|\xe2\x80\x9d Li said.  China\xe2\x80\x99s economic and financial risks\xe2\x80\x9care generally under control\xe2\x80\x9d but more needs to be done to resolve issues such as local government debt| Li said. He also said China will improve supervision over shadow banking| internet finance and financial holding companies| and step up risk controls at financial institutions.   DEFICIT TARGET TRIMMED Li said China has cut its budget deficit target to 2.6 percent of GDP from 3 percent in 2017. Most analysts had expected it to be maintained or trimmed only slightly. However| since the economy has been expanding at such a strong pace| analysts said the cut was again more symbolic of Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s intention to further control debt growth.    \xe2\x80\x9cThe actual figure is even lower than we expected...a 2.6 percent deficit would be about 2.3 trillion yuan ($363.5 billion) in absolute terms| which equals to the 2016 level|\xe2\x80\x9d said ANZ\xe2\x80\x99s Wang.\xe2\x80\x9cIt shows the government\xe2\x80\x99s determination to control leverage in the economy.\xe2\x80\x9d Chinese Premier Li Keqiang takes his seat after delivering the speech during the opening session of the National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing| China March 5| 2018. REUTERS/Damir SagoljHeavy government infrastructure spending was a major driver behind China\xe2\x80\x99s forecast-beating growth last year| but Beijing has been cracking down recently on some projects launched by local governments as it seeks to curb their spending.  Despite the lower deficit ratio| the absolute amount of the deficit is expected to remain unchanged at 2.38 trillion yuan  ($376 billion)| according to the finance ministry\xe2\x80\x99s annual budget report. MONETARY POLICY NEUTRAL Li also reiterated that China will keep its monetary policy\xe2\x80\x9cprudent\xe2\x80\x9d and\xe2\x80\x9cneutral\xe2\x80\x9d| neither too loose nor too tight| and will maintain reasonably steady liquidity| he said.  While the central bank has been gingerly raising money market rates to discourage riskier lending practices| it has also kept markets well supplied with funds when there are worries of a deeper cash squeeze| and bank lending hit a fresh record last year. Li also said he expects reasonable growth in broad M2 money supply and total social financing this year| without stating a target.   A member of the security personnel keeps watch at the end of the opening session of the National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing| China March 5| 2018. REUTERS/Thomas PeterThe National Development and Reform Commission| the state planner| said separately that outstanding total social financing (TSF) and M2 will grow at a similar pace this year as in 2017. TSF grew 12 percent last year| in line with the target| but M2 growth slowed to 8.2 percent| below the goal of around 12 percent. ANZ had expected both targets to be set at 10 percent or lower this year.    \xe2\x80\x9cIf I remember it right| it\xe2\x80\x99s the first time that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific target in two decades. It shows authorities now prefer a tighter stance on monetary policy|\xe2\x80\x9d Wang said.  \xe2\x80\x9cOverall both monetary and fiscal policy will be tighter than last year| because the government wants to control financial leverage and overall debt levels.\xe2\x80\x9d China also set its consumer inflation goal at\xe2\x80\x9caround 3 percent\xe2\x80\x9d| in line with last year| as widely expected. Stability will be the watchword this year as President Xi Jinping pursues his vision of turning China into a\xe2\x80\x9cmodestly prosperous\xe2\x80\x9d nation by 2020. To hit the 2020 goal| the economy needs to expand at least 6.3 annually over the next three years| officials have said.  Xi also wants China to become a\xe2\x80\x9cstrong power\xe2\x80\x9d on the world stage by 2050.   In the government\xe2\x80\x99s 2018 budget report| defense spending saw its biggest increase in three years. China will also continue to cut more steel and coal production| deepening its vow to make\xe2\x80\x9cskies blue again\xe2\x80\x9d| as Beijing chases quality over dizzying| polluting growth. The ruling Communist Party last month set the stage for Xi  to stay in office indefinitely| with a proposal to remove term limits from the constitution. Key Xi ally| former top graft buster Wang Qishan| sat on the same row as Standing Committee members on the front stage of the Great Hall| despite having stepped down from the elite seven-man body which runs China in October.

b'Shares falter on trade war fears; euro choppy amid Italian uncertaintyAsian investors dumped shares and drove to the safety of the yen and gold on Monday amid fears of a global trade war and worries of political uncertainty in Italy| risks that cloud the outlook for world growth.,5:54am GMT,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-global-markets/shares-falter-on-trade-war-fears-euro-choppy-amid-italian-uncertainty-idUKKBN1GG13H,SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian investors dumped shares and drove to the safety of the yen and gold on Monday amid fears of a global trade war and worries of political uncertainty in Italy| risks that cloud the outlook for world growth.   Italian voters delivered a hung parliament on Sunday| flocking to anti-establishment and far-right parties in record numbers and casting the euro zone\xe2\x80\x99s third-largest economy into a political gridlock that could take months to clear. The euro traded choppily around $1.2320| easing from a two-week high of $1.2365 as the eurosceptic 5-Star Movement saw its support soar to become the largest single party| according to projections based on early vote-counting. In the United States| President Donald Trump proposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminium| a pledge that met with warnings of retaliation from the rest of the world over the weekend.   The spectre of a global trade war hit risk appetite| sending MSCI\xe2\x80\x99s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 0.8 percent to the lowest since mid-February. U.S. stock futures did not inspire much confidence| with S&P; E-Minis down 0.6 percent and Dow futures off 0.4 percent. \xe2\x80\x9cThe messy Italian election result adds a bit to the nervousness to global equity markets at present|\xe2\x80\x9d said Shane Oliver| Sydney-based chief economist at AMP.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Italian election...does run the risk of making Italy\xe2\x80\x99s public finances worse than they already are with no progress in addressing Italy\xe2\x80\x99s long-term competitiveness problems.\xe2\x80\x9d  The euro still found support after Germany\xe2\x80\x99s Social Democrat party decisively backed the renewal of an alliance with  Chancellor Angela Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s conservatives| allowing her to form a new government more than five months since the country\xe2\x80\x99s inconclusive election. The single currency also got a lift from some safe-haven flows| as did the Japanese yen. The dollar fell for a fourth straight session to trade around 105.52 yen| but was slightly above Friday\xe2\x80\x99s low of 105.23| a level not seen since November 2016.  \xe2\x80\x9cNothing\xe2\x80\x99s happened over the weekend to soften concerns about trade wars or retaliatory actions by other countries|\xe2\x80\x9d said Ray Attrill| head of forex strategy at National Australia Bank.\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no rowing back so that gets us to a cautious start.\xe2\x80\x9d Canada and Mexico have threatened retaliation| and the European Union said it would apply 25 percent tariffs on about $3.5 billion of imports from the United States if Trump carried out his threat. China said on Sunday it did not want a trade war with the United States but will defend its interests| warning that policies based on\xe2\x80\x9cmistaken assumptions\xe2\x80\x9d will damage bilateral relations.  SOFT SHARES Investors fear the current momentum in the global economy could be lost if Trump starts a trade war. Asian markets were a sea of red with Japan\xe2\x80\x99s Nikkei and South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s KOSPI both down about 1 percent| while Chinese shares eased too after starting on a positive note.   Hong Kong\xe2\x80\x99s Hang Seng index slipped 1.4 percent. \xe2\x80\x9cFrustration with a lack of market access and a lack of fair trade are understandable|\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter Jolly| global head of research for National Australia Bank. \xe2\x80\x9cIf this escalation draws that into focus with some improvement| that would be positive. But retaliatory tit-for-tat measures would weigh against market access| a cost to growth with increases in trade prices| costs| and inflation.\xe2\x80\x9d Investors will keep an eye on a deluge of data this week| culminating in the U.S. non-farm payrolls on Friday. The annual opening of the National People\xe2\x80\x99s Congress in China was another focus for investors. China\xe2\x80\x99s parliament has kept the economy\xe2\x80\x99s growth target at 6.5 percent for this year. In commodities| oil prices climbed ahead of a meeting between OPEC and U.S. shale firms in Houston| raising expectations that oil producers would discuss further how to clear a global glut.

b"Insurer AXA agrees to buy XL Group for around $15 billionAXA | Europe's second-biggest insurer| has agreed to buy Bermuda-based XL Group  for around $15 billion (11 billion pounds)| in a deal which AXA said would create a world leader in property and casualty insurance.,9:03am GMT,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-xl-grp-m-a-axa/insurer-axa-agrees-to-buy-xl-group-for-around-15-billion-idUKKBN1GH0MI,PARIS (Reuters) - AXA| Europe\xe2\x80\x99s second-biggest insurer| has agreed to buy Bermuda-based XL Group for around $15 billion| in a deal which AXA said would create a world leader in property and casualty insurance. The French insurer said it was offering $57.60 for each XL share| representing a premium of 33 percent to XL\xe2\x80\x99s closing share price on March 2. The total consideration for the deal would amount to $15.3 billion. Insurers around the world have started to strike up takeover deals in order to strengthen their businesses as they face tougher regulation and falling returns based on financial markets investments. Related CoverageAXA\xe2\x80\x99s takeover of XL comes just over a month after rival American International Group said it would buy reinsurer Validus for around $5.6 billion.    AXA Chief Executive Thomas Buberl said the deal will enable AXA| predominantly a life and savings insurer| to dominate the global property and casualty market. \xe2\x80\x9cThe transaction offers significant long-term value creation for our stakeholders with increased risk diversification| higher cash remittance potential and reinforced growth prospects|\xe2\x80\x9d Buberl said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe future AXA will see its profile significantly rebalanced towards insurance risks and away from financial risks|\xe2\x80\x9d he added. However| AXA shares fell 5 percent in early trading| as some analysts said the XL deal looked pricey. \xe2\x80\x9cIn our view| the acquisition of XL fits AXA\xe2\x80\x99s strategy of growing in commercial insurance. However| the purchase price looks quite high even after synergy effects and AXA\xe2\x80\x99s debt ratio is again rather stretched|\xe2\x80\x9d said analysts at German brokerage Bankhaus Lampe| who kept a\xe2\x80\x9chold\xe2\x80\x9d rating on AXA shares. AXA| which ranks as Europe\xe2\x80\x99s second-biggest insurer in terms of market capitalization behind Germany\xe2\x80\x99s Allianz| said it would finance the XL deal via debt| cash and the proceeds of the forthcoming flotation of its U.S. business. It added it expected the XL takeover to be cash accretive| and to result in cost synergies of around $400 million per year| based on pre-tax earnings. AXA also reaffirmed its 2020 financial targets| under which the French insurer aims to increase earnings per share by 3 to 7 percent a year over the 2016-2020 period. AXA has not been hit as hard as some of its rivals by a series of costly natural catastrophes in 2017| thanks to reinsurance contracts and its diversified business model. AXA reported higher than expected net 2017 profit of 6.2 billion euros last month. Law firm Skadden said it was advising XL over the AXA takeover.

The grey and imposing silhouette of the USS Carl Vinson could be seen on Monday morning from the cliff tops just outside the central Vietnamese city of Danang| where the 103|000-tonne carrier and two other U.S. ships begin a five-day visit. \xe2\x80\x9cThe visit marks an enormously significant milestone in our bilateral relations and demonstrates U.S. support for a strong| prosperous| and independent Vietnam|\xe2\x80\x9d Daniel Kritenbrink| the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam| said in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cThrough hard work| mutual respect| and by continuing to address the past while we work towards a better future| we have gone from former enemies to close partners.\xe2\x80\x9d The arrival of the Vinson marks the biggest U.S. military presence in Vietnam since 1975 - but it also illustrates Hanoi\xe2\x80\x99s complex and evolving relationship with Beijing over the disputed South China Sea. Vietnamese envoys had been working for months to ease the concerns of their giant Chinese neighbour over the visit and the prospect of broader security cooperation between Hanoi and Washington| according to diplomats and others familiar with the talks. U.S. carriers frequently ply the South China Sea in a rising pattern of naval deployments| and are now routinely shadowed by Chinese naval vessels| naval officers in the region say. China\xe2\x80\x99s rapid construction and build-up of the land it holds in the disputed Spratly islands group has alarmed Vietnam and other regional governments as it seeks to enforce its claims to much of the disputed waterway| through which some $3 trillion in trade passes each year.     FILE PHOTO: U.S. aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson is seen in the Pacific Ocean on May 27| 2017.    Torrey W. Lee/Courtesy U.S. Navy/Handout via REUTERS/File PhotoWhile some Chinese commentators have used the Vinson\xe2\x80\x99s presence to demand an even greater Chinese military build-up in the South China Sea| official reaction from Beijing has been relatively muted since the stop was announced in January. That announcement came during a two-day visit to Hanoi by U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis and followed months of backroom military diplomacy between Hanoi and the Pentagon. Although no U.S. aircraft carrier has been to Vietnam since the end of the war| other| smaller U.S. warships have made high-level visits as ties improved in recent years. That includes a 2016 visit by submarine tender USS Frank Cable and guided-missile destroyer USS John S. McCain to Cam Ranh Bay| a crucial logistics complex during the Vietnam War. A U.S. Navy band will play a concert in Danang during the Vinson\xe2\x80\x99s visit| and sailors from the carrier are scheduled to spend time at a treatment centre for people who were exposed to Agent Orange chemicals during the war.

Both North Korea and the United States have expressed willingness to talk| but U.S. President Donald Trump demands the North\xe2\x80\x9cdenuke\xe2\x80\x9d first. The North| which has vowed never to give up its nuclear deterrent against U.S. hostility| says it will not sit down to talks under preconditions. Reclusive North Korea| which has made no secret of its pursuit of a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the mainland United States in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions| is also concerned over a joint U.S.-South Korea military exercise| which it sees as a preparation for war. South Korean officials have said the drill will start next month as planned| after being postponed for the Winter Olympics held last month in the South.

Inter-Korean talks began after Kim Jong Un said in his New Year\xe2\x80\x99s address that he wanted to engage the South.

b"Assad vows to press Ghouta assault| as civilians flee government advancesSyrian President Bashar al-Assad vowed to continue an offensive in eastern Ghouta near Damascus on Sunday as his forces advanced into the last major rebel enclave near the capital.,3:06am GMT,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-syria-ghouta/assad-vows-to-press-ghouta-assault-as-civilians-flee-government-advances-idUKKBN1GG08K,BEIRUT/GENEVA (Reuters) - Syrian President Bashar al-Assad vowed to continue an offensive in eastern Ghouta near Damascus on Sunday as his forces advanced into the last major rebel enclave near the capital. The offensive is one of the deadliest in the war and one local insurgent group called it a\xe2\x80\x9cscorched earth\xe2\x80\x9d campaign. The government is pressing on despite Western calls for it to abide by a 30-day| countrywide ceasefire demanded by the U.N. Security Council. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will continue fighting terrorism ... and the Ghouta operation is a continuation of fighting terrorism|\xe2\x80\x9d Assad said in comments to journalists broadcast on state TV. The advances have forced thousands of civilians to flee deeper into the rebel-held territory| where some 400|000 people live| the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and a resident said on Sunday. Government forces need to advance just a few more kilometres (miles) further to split the enclave in two| said a commander in the military alliance that backs Assad. The Observatory said government forces had seized a quarter of the territory. Assad said there was no contradiction between daily| five-hour humanitarian ceasefires called by his ally Russia| and ongoing combat operations| noting that advances by government forces in the last few days had occurred during the truce. The Russian ceasefire plan calls for five-hour pauses to allow for aid deliveries and evacuations of civilians and wounded. The U.S. State Department has called the Russian plan a\xe2\x80\x9cjoke\xe2\x80\x9d and the White House on Sunday accused Russia of killing Syrian civilians.  Assad| in his first comments on the offensive| said most people in Ghouta wanted to return to state rule. Related CoverageFrance's Macron called Turkey's Erdogan to discuss Syria's GhoutaIn eastern Ghouta rubble| a father looks for his son\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore we must continue with the operation and in parallel open the way for civilians to leave|\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Russia and Damascus have accused rebels of preventing civilians from leaving eastern Ghouta during the daily ceasefires. Rebels have consistently denied this accusation and say people will not leave because they fear the government. A U.N. humanitarian official said people in eastern Ghouta were being subjected to unacceptable\xe2\x80\x9ccollective punishment\xe2\x80\x9d| which is illegal under the Geneva Conventions. Assad dismissed Western statements about the humanitarian situation in eastern Ghouta as\xe2\x80\x9ca ridiculous lie\xe2\x80\x9d. With the war entering its eighth year| capturing the eastern Ghouta area would be a major victory for Assad| who has steadily recovered control of rebellious areas with Russian and Iranian support. The White House| in its strongest accusations of Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s complicity in the offensive to date| said on Sunday that Russian military aircraft carried out at least 20 daily bombing missions in Damascus and eastern Ghouta between Feb. 24 and Feb. 28. \xe2\x80\x9cRussia has gone on to ignore (a U.N. ceasefire\xe2\x80\x99s) terms and to kill innocent civilians under the false auspices of counter-terrorism operations|\xe2\x80\x9d the White House said in a statement| saying the Russian aircraft had taken off from Syria\xe2\x80\x99s Humaymim Airfield.

Rebels eventually withdrew from eastern Aleppo in late 2016 in a mediated deal| leaving to opposition-held territory near the Turkish border. The multi-sided war| which has killed hundreds of thousands of people since 2011| has escalated on several fronts this year| as the collapse of Islamic State has given way to other conflicts between Syrian and international parties.    \xe2\x80\x9cSCORCHED EARTH\xe2\x80\x9d One of the main insurgent groups in eastern Ghouta| Jaish al-Islam| said the government\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9cscorched earth policy\xe2\x80\x9d had forced rebels to retreat and regroup| but vowed to recover lost territory. One resident estimated that thousands of people were on the move and seeking shelter in areas further from the frontlines. Slideshow (2 Images)The Observatory estimated that between 300 to 400 families| which is likely several thousand people| had fled areas seized by government forces since Saturday. The pro-Assad commander said civilians were fleeing to the town of Douma.  The Observatory says government shelling and air strikes have killed 659 people in eastern Ghouta since Feb. 18| while rebel shelling of Damascus has killed 27.     U.N. regional humanitarian coordinator Panos Moumtzis said violence has escalated in eastern Ghouta and mortars fired into Damascus had killed and injured scores of civilians. \xe2\x80\x9cInstead of a much-needed reprieve| we continue to see more fighting| more death| and more disturbing reports of hunger and hospitals being bombed|\xe2\x80\x9d Moumtzis said in a statement. The United Nations later issued a statement saying it had received approval for a 46-truck convoy to the Ghouta town of Douma on Monday| carrying health and nutrition supplies| and food for 27|500 people. A second trip was planned for Thursday. Earlier| a U.N. official in Syria told Reuters a humanitarian convoy carrying life-saving supplies would not enter eastern Ghouta as had been planned on Sunday| citing a lack of permission. \xe2\x80\x9cDISTURBING REPORTS\xe2\x80\x9d Moumtzis also expressed concern about the situation in Afrin| a Kurdish region under Turkish assault since January| saying there were\xe2\x80\x9cdisturbing reports\xe2\x80\x9d of civilian deaths and injuries and restrictions on civilian movement. Turkey| backed by Syrian militias| has gained ground in recent days in Afrin. The Observatory said the advancing forces could soon besiege Afrin city| where 1 million people live.  The Observatory said Turkish forces had advanced to within 12 km (7 miles) of Afrin. Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s army said on Sunday it captured seven settlements including the town of Sheikh Hadid. Turkish forces have taken control of the roads from Rajo and Jandaris to Afrin| it also said in a statement. Turkey has rejected Western calls for it to suspend the Afrin assault in line with the U.N. ceasefire| which does not apply to Islamic State| al Qaeda and groups associated with it| or other groups deemed terrorists by the Security Council. Turkey views the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Party (PKK)| which has fought a three-decade insurgency in Turkey and is deemed a terrorist group by the United States| the European Union and Turkey.

After hitting a 6-month low at the open| the pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.3 percent by 0825 GMT. Italy\xe2\x80\x99s FTSE MIB blue-chip index was down 1 percent| also a six-month low.  Gains in energy and materials stocks however supported the broader marker. They were helped by a rise in crude oil prices ahead of a meeting between OPEC and U.S. shale firms that raised expectations that producers would discuss further how to clear a global oil glut.  Italy faces a prolonged period of political instability after voters delivered a hung parliament in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s election| spurning traditional parties and flocking to anti-establishment and far-right groups in record numbers.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe expect lengthy negotiations after these elections| which may lead to increased volatility of Italian assets|\xe2\x80\x9d said Matteo Ramenghi| CIO at UBS WM Italy. Italian banks| which are seen as a proxy for political risk given their large government bond holdings| hit their lowest in nearly two months| falling 1.4 percent. U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened European automakers with a tax on imports if the European Union retaliates against his plan to slap tariffs on aluminium and steel.

Trump is expected to finalize the tariffs - 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum - later in the week| posing a tough challenge for U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer| Canada\xe2\x80\x99s Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo. The Mexican and Canadian ministers are likely to press Trump\xe2\x80\x99s trade envoy on whether their countries will be excluded from the blanket tariffs. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect it to be front and center\xe2\x80\x9d at the meeting| said Kevin Brady| the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee| which oversees U.S. trade policy. Officials have so far been evasive when asked how the three nations can continue trying to update the North American Free Trade Agreement at a time when the U.S. president is about to take a highly protectionist measure. Brady led a delegation of U.S. lawmakers to Mexico City to press officials on the need to conclude the talks| which have unnerved financial markets worried about the possibility that the North American supply chain could be disrupted. Speaking on Sunday| Brady said all fairly-traded steel should be excluded from the tariffs. U.S. stocks fell sharply on Thursday on fears of a looming trade war after Trump| a Republican| announced the planned tariffs.

Eight days of talks in Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s capital failed to make headway on new rules governing the content of products made in North America| which has been one of the most contentious issues in the talks. The U.S. negotiator charged with overseeing the so-called rules of origin unexpectedly returned to Washington for consultations early on and did not return. Talks on the matter will be rescheduled before the expected next proper NAFTA round in Washington in early April. Still| Brady said he was impressed with the progress made during the week| emphasizing it was important to finish negotiating a modern| pro-growth agreement that would boost manufacturing and jobs. U.S. Representative Roger Marshall| a Republican who traveled with Brady to Mexico| said meetings during the week had closed chapters related to chemicals| communications and anti-corruption efforts. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very optimistic|\xe2\x80\x9d Marshall told reporters after briefings from U.S. trade officials.

Italian voters delivered a hung parliament on Sunday| flocking to anti-establishment and far-right parties in record numbers and casting the euro zone\xe2\x80\x99s third-largest economy into a political gridlock that could take months to clear. The euro traded choppily around $1.2320| easing from a two-week high of $1.2365 as the eurosceptic 5-Star Movement saw its support soar to become the largest single party| according to projections based on early vote-counting. In the United States| President Donald Trump proposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminium| a pledge that met with warnings of retaliation from the rest of the world over the weekend.   The spectre of a global trade war hit risk appetite| sending MSCI\xe2\x80\x99s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 0.8 percent to the lowest since mid-February. U.S. stock futures did not inspire much confidence| with S&P; E-Minis down 0.6 percent and Dow futures off 0.4 percent. \xe2\x80\x9cThe messy Italian election result adds a bit to the nervousness to global equity markets at present|\xe2\x80\x9d said Shane Oliver| Sydney-based chief economist at AMP.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Italian election...does run the risk of making Italy\xe2\x80\x99s public finances worse than they already are with no progress in addressing Italy\xe2\x80\x99s long-term competitiveness problems.\xe2\x80\x9d  The euro still found support after Germany\xe2\x80\x99s Social Democrat party decisively backed the renewal of an alliance with  Chancellor Angela Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s conservatives| allowing her to form a new government more than five months since the country\xe2\x80\x99s inconclusive election. The single currency also got a lift from some safe-haven flows| as did the Japanese yen. The dollar fell for a fourth straight session to trade around 105.52 yen| but was slightly above Friday\xe2\x80\x99s low of 105.23| a level not seen since November 2016.  \xe2\x80\x9cNothing\xe2\x80\x99s happened over the weekend to soften concerns about trade wars or retaliatory actions by other countries|\xe2\x80\x9d said Ray Attrill| head of forex strategy at National Australia Bank.\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no rowing back so that gets us to a cautious start.\xe2\x80\x9d Canada and Mexico have threatened retaliation| and the European Union said it would apply 25 percent tariffs on about $3.5 billion of imports from the United States if Trump carried out his threat. China said on Sunday it did not want a trade war with the United States but will defend its interests| warning that policies based on\xe2\x80\x9cmistaken assumptions\xe2\x80\x9d will damage bilateral relations.  SOFT SHARES Investors fear the current momentum in the global economy could be lost if Trump starts a trade war. Asian markets were a sea of red with Japan\xe2\x80\x99s Nikkei and South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s KOSPI both down about 1 percent| while Chinese shares eased too after starting on a positive note.   Hong Kong\xe2\x80\x99s Hang Seng index slipped 1.4 percent. \xe2\x80\x9cFrustration with a lack of market access and a lack of fair trade are understandable|\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter Jolly| global head of research for National Australia Bank. \xe2\x80\x9cIf this escalation draws that into focus with some improvement| that would be positive. But retaliatory tit-for-tat measures would weigh against market access| a cost to growth with increases in trade prices| costs| and inflation.\xe2\x80\x9d Investors will keep an eye on a deluge of data this week| culminating in the U.S. non-farm payrolls on Friday. The annual opening of the National People\xe2\x80\x99s Congress in China was another focus for investors. China\xe2\x80\x99s parliament has kept the economy\xe2\x80\x99s growth target at 6.5 percent for this year. In commodities| oil prices climbed ahead of a meeting between OPEC and U.S. shale firms in Houston| raising expectations that oil producers would discuss further how to clear a global glut.

b"China keeps growth target at 6.5 percent| stays focused on financial risks,3:06am GMT,https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-china-parliament/china-keeps-growth-target-at-6-5-percent-stays-focused-on-financial-risks-idUKKBN1GH00J,BEIJING (Reuters) - China aims to expand its economy by around 6.5 percent this year| the same as in 2017| while pressing ahead with its campaign to reduce risks in the financial system| Premier Li Keqiang said Monday.  The goal was kept unchanged even though the economy grew 6.9 percent last year and exceeded the government\xe2\x80\x99s target. Sources previously told Reuters that China will maintain its growth target at\xe2\x80\x9caround 6.5 percent\xe2\x80\x9d.      Economists had already expected the world\xe2\x80\x99s second-largest economy to lose some momentum this year as the government deepens its push to contain a build-up in corporate debt| while a war on pollution and a cooling property market weigh on its manufacturers.  Reinforcing views that Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s attention remains firmly fixed on credit risks and better quality growth| when Li unveiled the GDP target he omitted previous wording saying growth could be\xe2\x80\x9chigher if possible.\xe2\x80\x9d   In his annual work report| Li also said China has cut its budget deficit target for the first time since 2012| suggesting Beijing will be more watchful of fiscal spending while not tapping the brakes so hard that it risks a sharper slowdown. \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy wise| the report definitely has a tightening bias|\xe2\x80\x9d said Betty Wang| senior China economist at ANZ in Hong Kong.\xe2\x80\x9cIn line with expectations| the government is pushing through their reform agenda.\xe2\x80\x9d But last week\xe2\x80\x99s escalation in trade tensions with the United States has jumped to the top of the list of uncertainties facing China this year.  President Donald Trump said he would impose hefty tariffs on imported steel and aluminum to protect U.S. producers| risking retaliation from major trade partners like China and sparking fears of a global trade war.   Li said China opposes protectionism and supports the settlement of trade disputes through negotiation| but will\xe2\x80\x9cresolutely safeguard\xe2\x80\x9d its legitimate rights and interest. Related CoverageChina cuts budget deficit ratio for first time since 2012China says supports negotiation to settle trade disputesYet| China will keep its yuan currency basically stable| Li said in remarks to the opening of the annual meeting of parliament.  He said a steady rise in import and export volumes can be expected this year| a view unchanged from a year ago. No export target was given for the third straight year.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe can expect continued recovery of the global economy| but there are also many factors that bring instability and uncertainty|\xe2\x80\x9d the premier said.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe policy changes of the major economies and their spillover effects create uncertainty; protectionism is mounting| and geopolitical risks are on the ascent|\xe2\x80\x9d Li said.  China\xe2\x80\x99s economic and financial risks\xe2\x80\x9care generally under control\xe2\x80\x9d but more needs to be done to resolve issues such as local government debt| Li said. He also said China will improve supervision over shadow banking| internet finance and financial holding companies| and step up risk controls at financial institutions.   DEFICIT TARGET TRIMMED Li said China has cut its budget deficit target to 2.6 percent of GDP from 3 percent in 2017. Most analysts had expected it to be maintained or trimmed only slightly. However| since the economy has been expanding at such a strong pace| analysts said the cut was again more symbolic of Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s intention to further control debt growth.    \xe2\x80\x9cThe actual figure is even lower than we expected...a 2.6 percent deficit would be about 2.3 trillion yuan ($363.5 billion) in absolute terms| which equals to the 2016 level|\xe2\x80\x9d said ANZ\xe2\x80\x99s Wang.\xe2\x80\x9cIt shows the government\xe2\x80\x99s determination to control leverage in the economy.\xe2\x80\x9d Chinese Premier Li Keqiang takes his seat after delivering the speech during the opening session of the National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing| China March 5| 2018. REUTERS/Damir SagoljHeavy government infrastructure spending was a major driver behind China\xe2\x80\x99s forecast-beating growth last year| but Beijing has been cracking down recently on some projects launched by local governments as it seeks to curb their spending.  Despite the lower deficit ratio| the absolute amount of the deficit is expected to remain unchanged at 2.38 trillion yuan  ($376 billion)| according to the finance ministry\xe2\x80\x99s annual budget report. MONETARY POLICY NEUTRAL Li also reiterated that China will keep its monetary policy\xe2\x80\x9cprudent\xe2\x80\x9d and\xe2\x80\x9cneutral\xe2\x80\x9d| neither too loose nor too tight| and will maintain reasonably steady liquidity| he said.  While the central bank has been gingerly raising money market rates to discourage riskier lending practices| it has also kept markets well supplied with funds when there are worries of a deeper cash squeeze| and bank lending hit a fresh record last year. Li also said he expects reasonable growth in broad M2 money supply and total social financing this year| without stating a target.

REUTERS/Thomas PeterThe National Development and Reform Commission| the state planner| said separately that outstanding total social financing (TSF) and M2 will grow at a similar pace this year as in 2017. TSF grew 12 percent last year| in line with the target| but M2 growth slowed to 8.2 percent| below the goal of around 12 percent. ANZ had expected both targets to be set at 10 percent or lower this year.    \xe2\x80\x9cIf I remember it right| it\xe2\x80\x99s the first time that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific target in two decades. It shows authorities now prefer a tighter stance on monetary policy|\xe2\x80\x9d Wang said.  \xe2\x80\x9cOverall both monetary and fiscal policy will be tighter than last year| because the government wants to control financial leverage and overall debt levels.\xe2\x80\x9d China also set its consumer inflation goal at\xe2\x80\x9caround 3 percent\xe2\x80\x9d| in line with last year| as widely expected. Stability will be the watchword this year as President Xi Jinping pursues his vision of turning China into a\xe2\x80\x9cmodestly prosperous\xe2\x80\x9d nation by 2020. To hit the 2020 goal| the economy needs to expand at least 6.3 annually over the next three years| officials have said.  Xi also wants China to become a\xe2\x80\x9cstrong power\xe2\x80\x9d on the world stage by 2050.   In the government\xe2\x80\x99s 2018 budget report| defense spending saw its biggest increase in three years. China will also continue to cut more steel and coal production| deepening its vow to make\xe2\x80\x9cskies blue again\xe2\x80\x9d| as Beijing chases quality over dizzying| polluting growth. The ruling Communist Party last month set the stage for Xi  to stay in office indefinitely| with a proposal to remove term limits from the constitution.

b"Sky and Wiggins crossed 'ethical line' - UK parliamentary report,3:06am GMT,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-doping-britain-report/sky-and-wiggins-crossed-ethical-line-uk-parliamentary-report-idUKKBN1GH04J,LONDON (Reuters) - Team Sky crossed an\xe2\x80\x9cethical line\xe2\x80\x9d by using permitted medication to enhance the performance of Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins| said a British parliamentary committee report published on Monday. Team Sky immediately issued a statement to\xe2\x80\x9cstrongly refute\xe2\x80\x9d the claim. The long-awaited Digital| Culture| Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee report on\xe2\x80\x98Combatting doping in sport\xe2\x80\x99 said the widespread therapeutic use exemption (TUE) system was open to abuse. It was unable to say for sure what was in a mysterious package delivered to Wiggins at the June 2011 Criterium du Dauphine race but found no\xe2\x80\x9creliable evidence\xe2\x80\x9d to support Sky\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that it was a legal decongestant. The committee said it believed a powerful corticosteroid| triamcinolone| was being used\xe2\x80\x9cto prepare Bradley Wiggins| and possibly other riders supporting him| for the Tour de France. \xe2\x80\x9cThe purpose of this was not to treat medical need| but to improve his power to weight ratio ahead of the race.\xe2\x80\x9d Wiggins| an asthma sufferer who has said he sought no unfair advantage| had been granted a TUE for the banned anti-inflammatory ahead of the 2012 Tour. The report said that while there was no violation of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) code|\xe2\x80\x9cit does cross the ethical line that (team principal) David Brailsford says he himself drew for Team Sky.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIn this case| and contrary to the testimony of David Brailsford in front of the Committee| we believe that drugs were being used by Team Sky| within the WADA rules| to enhance the performance of riders| and not just to treat medical need.\xe2\x80\x9d The report also accused Sky and British Cycling of\xe2\x80\x9cserious| unprofessional and inexcusable\xe2\x80\x9d behaviour in failing to keep proper medical records.  Team Sky said they took full responsibility for mistakes made in areas where they had already acknowledged they fell short. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever| the Report also makes the serious claim that medication has been used by the Team to enhance performance. We strongly refute this|\xe2\x80\x9d the statement said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe report also includes an allegation of widespread Triamcinolone use by Team Sky riders ahead of the 2012 Tour de France. Again| we strongly refute this allegation.\xe2\x80\x9d Sky said they were surprised and disappointed that the committee had\xe2\x80\x9cchosen to present an anonymous and potentially malicious claim in this way| without presenting any evidence or giving us an opportunity to respond.\xe2\x80\x9d The report also strongly criticised world athletics head Sebastian Coe for providing\xe2\x80\x9cmisleading\xe2\x80\x9d answers to questions in a 2015 hearing about what he knew about doping in Russian athletics before he took office. It said the reputation of both the Briton and IAAF had been affected. \xe2\x80\x9cIt stretches credibility to believe that he was not aware| at least in general terms| of the main allegations that the Ethics Commission had been asked to investigate|\xe2\x80\x9d the report added. Coe| a double Olympic 1|500 metres gold medallist| denied last year that he had misled the committee. The committee said UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) should have greater powers and resources to conduct investigations and enforce rules. It called also for legislation to be introduced to criminalise the supply of drugs to athletes with the intent to enhance performance. Our Standards:\n"

May said her vision for future ties to the EU was a credible one and she was confident of reaching a good Brexit deal| in an interview broadcast on Sunday but recorded on Friday after a speech in which she had appealed for more flexibility from the bloc. Setting out her thinking in more detail| May said the financial services sector was too important to the British economy for Brussels to retain control of it under the existing\xe2\x80\x98passporting\xe2\x80\x99 arrangement. Passporting rules allow EU finance companies to sell their services across the 28-member bloc with a local license| rather than getting a license to operate in each member country where it does business. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we were to accept\xe2\x80\x98passporting\xe2\x80\x99 we\xe2\x80\x99d just be a rule taker| we\xe2\x80\x99d have to abide by the rules that were being set elsewhere|\xe2\x80\x9d May said in the interview with the BBC. \xe2\x80\x9cGiven the importance of financial stability| of ensuring the City of London| we can\xe2\x80\x99t just take the same rules without any say in them|\xe2\x80\x9d May said. The Confederation of British Industry lobby group said it was important to make sure alternative arrangements were put in place to prevent firms leaving London. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we do have an opening negotiating position. It needs to be followed through| it needs to be followed through very quickly because financial services firms are moving now|\xe2\x80\x9d CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn told BBC radio.

But| underlining the challenge May faces| Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s foreign minister Simon Coveney said on Sunday she still needed to spell out her approach to the Irish border - which will become the only land frontier between Britain and the EU after Brexit. \xe2\x80\x9cShe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really gone into any more detail than we\xe2\x80\x99ve already heard in terms of how she is going to solve the problem of maintaining a largely invisible border on the island of Ireland|\xe2\x80\x9d Coveney told the BBC.

At the helm of the National Front (FN) since 2011| Le Pen has taken it further than her maverick father| FN founder Jean-Marie Le Pen| ever did| winning municipalities and EU elections by making the party more palatable to mainstream voters. But a disastrous TV debate before last year\xe2\x80\x99s presidential run-off against Macron| a lower-than-expected score in that second round and a disappointing number - eight - of FN lawmakers elected afterwards| shook Le Pen and the party. She quickly pledged to overhaul the FN. And an FN congress on March 10-11 will be a chance for her to reassert her leadership and win approval for a shift away from the unpopular anti-euro focus of her presidential run to better take on conservative Les Republicains leader Laurent Wauquiez. \xe2\x80\x9cIn France| there is a habit of announcing our death as soon as we\xe2\x80\x99re somewhat weakened. But each time they buried us| we came back stronger|\xe2\x80\x9d said Le Pen| 49| who got 33.9 percent of the vote in the presidential run-off. \xe2\x80\x9cThe name change will mark the end of a chapter and the start of a new one| that of a party suited to being in power and striking alliances|\xe2\x80\x9d she told the APE foreign press association last month. While Jean Marie Le Pen has warned that altering such a well-known brand could be political suicide| local FN officials said their experience on the ground argued strongly for such a move. [L8N1QH3HY] \xe2\x80\x9cThe name change is essential to enable us to strike alliances and talk with voters without what is often an almost automatic negative reaction|\xe2\x80\x9d said Davy Rodriguez| the 24-year-old deputy head of the National Front\xe2\x80\x99s youth movement. \xe2\x80\x9cWe meet people who agree with us on everything...| but when we say\xe2\x80\x98Hi| we are the National Front\xe2\x80\x99| they say|\xe2\x80\x98No| no| not the National Front!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d    The National Front brand remains very much associated in many voters\xe2\x80\x99 minds with Le Pen\xe2\x80\x99s firebrand father| who has been convicted several times for incitement to racial hatred.  \xe2\x80\x9cCHANGED OUR LINE\xe2\x80\x9d The second key aspect of the FN rebranding is| as other European far-right parties have done| a watering down of its stance against the European Union\xe2\x80\x99s common currency.

REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol/File PhotoThough popular with the FN\xe2\x80\x99s core electorate| anti-euro campaigning has proved a turnoff for most French voters. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re keeping our fundamentals| our basis: security| immigration|\xe2\x80\x9d said FN lawmaker and party spokesman Sebastien Chenu.\xe2\x80\x9cBut new faces will appear| and we have changed our line on Europe| on the euro.\xe2\x80\x9d     The objective is to break the FN\xe2\x80\x99s isolation from the mainstream. Le Pen seeks to head a more inclusive\xe2\x80\x9cpatriotic\xe2\x80\x9d camp as small and large parties alike scramble to reinvent themselves after the unprecedented election victory of newcomer Macron\xe2\x80\x99s neither-left-nor-right recipe for politics. Macron defeated long-established left and right parties by pledging reforms| particularly to liberalise the economy and rigid labour laws| based on pragmatism rather than ideology.

It\xe2\x80\x99s time for those who defend the nation to get together.\xe2\x80\x9d  Among potential allies she is sizing up is Nicolas Dupont-Aignan| leader of a small nationalist party who backed Le Pen between the two rounds of the presidential election| and others heading fringe right-wing parties. FN officials say the party will also pursue case-by-case deals for local elections with conservatives or others without a political affiliation. The question is whether this will yield significant gains at the ballot box| especially at a time when Wauquiez is openly targeting FN voters. He has dismissed Macron as out of touch with rural France| weak on security and overly in favour of closer EU integration - all hot button issues for the FN. Doubts about Le Pen\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to broaden the FN\xe2\x80\x99s popular base more than she already has may be hard to overcome| say analysts and even some party sympathisers. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe Le Pen\xe2\x80\x99s name is putting off some people. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind that much if she resigned|\xe2\x80\x9d 16-year-old Enzo Niant said at a Le Pen rally in the northeastern region of Alsace last month.  \xe2\x80\x9cPart of the FN\xe2\x80\x99s rank and file doubt she can live up to their expectations|\xe2\x80\x9d said Ifop analyst Jerome Fourquet. But Le Pen\xe2\x80\x99s FN is likely to be a force to be reckoned with against Macron in coming years| most analysts say.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe inequalities and anger that are at the heart of the FN vote will not go away|\xe2\x80\x9d said Fourquet| citing worries about losses of famously secure French jobs to globalisation| Europe\xe2\x80\x99s migrant crisis and the Islamist militant threat.

Three aftershocks of magnitude greater than 5 shook the mountainous Southern Highlands| about 600 km (370 miles) northwest of the capital Port Moresby early on Monday| the U.S. Geological Survey said| including a shallow magnitude 6 quake. \xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t slept. It\xe2\x80\x99s been shaking all through the night|\xe2\x80\x9d  William Bando| provincial administrator of Hela Province| said by telephone from Tari| about 40 km (25 miles) from the site of the shocks. Related Coverage\xe2\x80\x9cWhat we experienced this morning could have caused more damage| but we don\xe2\x80\x99t know ... it almost threw me out of bed.\xe2\x80\x9d The region had already been badly damaged on Feb. 26| when the largest quake to hit the seismically-active highlands in nearly a century flattened buildings| triggered landslides| and closed oil and gas operations.     The toll on Monday stood at 55 killed| said James Justin| a research officer at the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy in Port Moresby| as news of more deaths arrived in the capital by shortwave radio. Most of the confirmed fatalities were in and around the provincial capital of Mendi and the township of Tari| he said| where landslides buried homes and buildings collapsed on families. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople are in great fear of their lives as the quakes are continuing ever since it started|\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\xe2\x80\x9cThey actually want to know when it will stop.\xe2\x80\x9d  While the region has no major urban centres| around 670|000 people live within 100 km (62 miles) of the epicentre| according to the Red Cross. (Graphic: Papua New Guinea quake| tmsnrt.rs/2ow1YLR) The quake has been felt on global natural gas markets| with ExxonMobil Corp declaring force majeure on exports from Papua New Guinea| according to an industry source| pushing Asian spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices 5 percent higher. The company declined to comment on the force majeure| but said production would be knocked out for about 8 weeks. [nL4N1QM0PD] Aid agencies have said nearly 150|000 people remain in urgent need of emergency supplies. Australia| New Zealand and the Red Cross have all pledged aid| though reaching the remote area has proven challenging as forbidding terrain| bad weather| as well as damaged roads and runways have delayed aid efforts. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only way for people to go out is by chopper| and it\xe2\x80\x99s slow for information to come through\xe2\x80\x9d| said Martin Mose| director of Papua New Guinea\xe2\x80\x99s National Disaster Centre| which has yet to complete a full assessment of damage.

A launch represents an investment|\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Privately held French supermarket operator Systeme U said last week that it was discussing a possible grocery supply deal with Amazon| though a major deal between Amazon and a French retailer has yet to materialize. Amazon has made small forays in that direction and has steadily been building its presence in France| where it has run its Amazon Prime Now express delivery service in Paris since 2016. Last month Amazon said it would create 2|000 new jobs in France and it has also settled a long-running dispute with French tax authorities that had been seeking nearly 200 million euros from the company. In a separate interview with Journal du Dimanche| French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said:\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xafAmazon is welcomed in France because my absolute priority is to create jobs| and Amazon represents thousands of jobs.\xe2\x80\x9d Le Maire also said that\xe2\x80\x9cpartnerships are under discussions between Amazon and some French groups| notably in the food products sector\xe2\x80\x9d and that the government would ensure fair competition.

It will be a considerable step. The (tax rate) range is 2 percent to 6 percent| we will be closer to 2 percent than 6 percent\xe2\x80\x9d| Le Maire told Le Journal du Dimanche. To those who might say the measure is too modest| Le Maire said his answer was:\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a starting point. I prefer a text that will be implemented very quickly rather than endless negotiations. We will fine tune it later\xe2\x80\x9d.

The proposal aims at increasing the tax bill of firms like Amazon.com ()| Alphabet\xe2\x80\x99s (GOOGL.O) Google and Facebook (FB.O)| which are accused by large EU states of paying too little by rerouting their EU profits to low-tax countries such as Luxembourg and Ireland. President Emmanuel Macron\xe2\x80\x99s government has proposed taxing the tech giants on revenues rather than profits| to get around the problem that the companies shift the profits from where they are earned to low tax jurisdictions.
